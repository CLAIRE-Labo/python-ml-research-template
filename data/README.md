# Instructions for the data

## [TEMPLATE] Where and how to set up the data

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **TEMPLATE TODO:**
> Update the instructions below to explain how to obtain the data and delete this section.

The template provides the `PROJECT_ROOT/data/` directory as a placeholder for the data used in the project.
This allows the experiment code to always refer to same path for the data independently of the deployment method
and the user configuration for better reproducibility.
The dataset directories in `PROJECT_ROOT/data/` don't actually need to be physically in the same directory
as the project, you can create symlinks to them.
This shifts the data path configuration from the code and config which should be identical across runs
to the installation steps.
This is also more convenient than using environment variables to point to individual dataset locations.

Below, you can instruct the users on how to download or link to the data and preprocess it.

When the data is small enough you can simply instruct the users to download it in the `PROJECT_ROOT/data/` directory.
Otherwise, you can provide hints to them on how to download it (or reuse parts of it) in separate storages
(potentially in a shared storage where some datasets already exists) and then create symlinks to it.
As these instructions to use separate storage will depend on the installation method, we advise moving
them to the `installation/*/README.md` file after the development environment installation instructions.
You can link back to this file for common instructions and information about download links.

* For the local conda installation method, this is only symlinks to other locations in the local filesystem. E.g.
  ```bash
  # The data set already exist at /absolute_path/to/some-dataset
  # FROM the PROJECT_ROOT do
  ln -s /absolute_path/to/some-dataset data/some-dataset
  ```
* For the local deployment option with Docker, you can edit the `../installation/docker-*/compose.yaml` and
  mount the individual datasets inside the `PROJECT_ROOT/data/` directory. Avoid nested mounts.
  Otherwise, you can do like the option below, to mount every shared dataset directory somewhere and symlink to them.
* For managed clusters (like the EPFL Run:ai/Kubernetes clusters),
  if you have shared datasets in separate storage as you project you can mount of all of those with your job
  and then create symlinks to them in the `PROJECT_ROOT/data/` directory. E.g.,
  ```bash
  # Make sure to consistently mount the storage with the same name.
  # E.g. for EPFL Run:ai always mount the PVC runai-claire-moalla-scratch to /claire-rcp-scratch

  # Dataset exists at /absolute_path/to/dataset
  # E.g. /claire-rcp-scratch/shared/datasets/some-large-dataset

  # From the PROJECT_ROOT do
  ln -s /absolute_path/to/dataset data/dataset
  ```
