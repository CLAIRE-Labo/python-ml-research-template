# Installation with Docker (OCI container)

## Template getting started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **TEMPLATE TODO:**
> Follow the instructions, then delete this section.

This template provides a Docker setup to define your environment.
For detailed information on the setup, refer to the next section [(_More details on the
setup_)](#more-details-on-the-setup).
Follow the steps below to get started.

1. Choose the platform and hardware acceleration that you will build the image for.
   You have to pick one as fully specified environment files are not trivially portable across platforms
   and hardware accelerations.
   Available packages may differ for different platforms and hardware accelerations,
   so in general, you cannot freeze an environment used for a platform and create it in another.

   The default platform is Linux (fixed) on AMD64 CPUs `amd64` (can be changed to e.g. `arm64`)
   with support for NVIDIA GPUs.
   (reflected in the name of the directory `docker-amd64-cuda` by default).
   To edit it, run
   ```bash
   # When in the PROJECT_ROOT directory.
   # For examples run:
   ./installation/edit-platform-and-acceleration.sh
   # To do the change run:
   ./installation/edit-platform-and-acceleration.sh docker CURR_PLATFORM CURR_ACCELERATION NEW_PLATFORM NEW_ACCELERATION
   # The hardware acceleration will be determined by the packages you install.
   # E.g. if you install PyTorch with CUDA, set the acceleration to cuda.
   ```
   The template currently supports setting only a single platform & hardware acceleration combination.
   You can always adapt it to have multiple platforms
   (in some cases, may just get away with adding a line to the build platforms,
   and in others may need separate Dockerfiles and environment files.
   Test them, and ensure your results/conclusions hold across platforms.)
2. The remaining commands will be run from this `installation/docker-amd64-cuda` directory.
   ```bash
   cd installation/docker-amd64-cuda
   ```
3. Choose whether you will start your image and environment from scratch (Ubuntu image and new conda environment),
   or if you will base it from an existing image already having a Python environment
   (e.g., the [NGC images](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/containers)).
    - The `from-scratch` installation is based on an Ubuntu image (which you can change if you want), installs
      conda and manages all the dependencies with it.

      This is a good option if you want full control over your environment, e.g., know exactly which system packages
      are installed, pick the Python version, pick all the Python dependencies, etc.
    - The `from-python` installation assumes that you base your image from an image which
      already has a Python environment and that this environment is well configured
      to be extended with pip, independently of how Python is installed
      (e.g. if with system Python like the NGC Pytorch image, nothing to do, but if with conda then
      the environment must be configured to be activated by default).

      This is a great option to get started quickly with a well-tuned environment, and only add missing
      dependencies.
      However, this comes at the cost of not choosing your Python version and
      not having a granular choice over your dependencies.

   The default base is `from-python` to quickly get started with the NGC images.
   Run the following if you want to edit it.
   ```bash
   # from-base can be from-scratch or from-python
   ./template.sh edit_from_base <from-base>
   ```
   Delete the two folders `from-scratch` and `from-python` after the choice is made.
4. Edit `compose-base.yaml` to specify your base image (`BASE_IMAGE`) and its eventual options.
   E.g., the NGC image you use as a base image and its entrypoint (`BASE_ENTRYPOINT`) in the `from-python` option
   or the Ubuntu and conda version (`CONDA_URL`) in the `from-scratch` option.
5. Specify your initial dependencies.
   Follow the [instructions to maintain the environment](#from-python-instructions-to-maintain-the-environment)
   up to (including) the manual editing section.
   Commit so that you can get back to this file to edit it manually.
   Delete the section of the from-base you are not using.
6. Build the environment following the instructions to [build the environment](#obtainingbuilding-the-environment).
   (Obviously, you'll have to build the generic images not pull them.)
7. Follow the instructions to [run the environment](#the-environment) with your target
   deployment option.
   If everything goes well (we suggested checking that all your dependencies are there
   and importing the complex ones), pin your dependencies following the
   instructions to [freeze the environment](#freeze-the-environment).
8. Push your generic images (run and dev with the root user) to some registry if not done already.
   This will be handy for you, for sharing it with your teammates, and when you open-source your project later.
    1. Find a public (or private for teammates) repository to push your generic images.
       E.g., your personal Docker Hub registry has free unlimited public repositories.
    2. Push the generic images to the registry you chose.
       ```bash
       ./template.sh push_generic FULL_IMAGE_NAME_WITH_REGISTRY
       ```
    3. Add this link to the TODO ADD PULL_IMAGE_NAME in
       the [obtaining/building the environment](#obtainingbuilding-the-environment)
       section of the README.
       (**EPFL Note**: _you can give the link to your generic image on your lab's registry to your teammates
       e.g., ic-registry.epfl.ch/your-lab/your-gaspar/template-project-name_.)

9. Remove the template sections that you've completed from this file (indicated with **TEMPLATE TODO**)
   to only leave the instructions relevant to the next users.

## More details on the setup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **TEMPLATE TODO:**
> Read/skim over this section, then delete it.

The setup is based on Docker and Docker Compose and is adapted from
the [Cresset template](https://github.com/cresset-template/cresset).
It is composed of Dockerfiles to build the image containing the runtime and development environments,
and Docker Compose files to set build arguments in the Dockerfile and run it locally.

Most of these files are templates that should suit most use cases.
They read project/user-specific information from the other files such as the project dependencies and user
configuration.
Typically, the files you will have to edit are `compose-base.yaml`, `.env`, and the `dependencies/` files,

Here's a summary of all the files in this directory.

### Details on the main Dockerfile

The Dockerfile specifies all the steps to build the environment in which your code will run.
It makes efficient use of caching and multi-stage builds to speed up build time and keep final images small.

Broadly, it has 3 main stages:

1. A stage to download, install, and build dependencies.
   It is used to build the Conda environment, for example, in the `from-scratch` option.
   This stage typically requires build-time dependencies such as compilers, etc. which are not needed
   at runtime.
2. A stage to install runtime dependencies and copy dependencies from the previous stage.
   Runtime dependencies are typically lighter than build-time dependencies.
3. A stage extending the runtime stage with development dependencies.
   These dependencies and utilities (e.g., vim, pretty shell, SSH server, etc.) are not needed at runtime
   but are useful when developing in the container.

The two last stages can be built without a user (the user will be root), or extended to include a user
(specified in your `.env` file later).
This is done in the `Dockerfile-user` file.

### Details on the Docker Compose files

The Docker Compose files are used to configure the build arguments used by the Dockerfile
when building the images and to configure the container when running it locally.

They support building multiple images corresponding to the runtime and development stages with or without a user
and running on each with either `cpu` or `cuda` support.

We provide a utility script, `template.sh`, to help you interact with Docker Compose.
It has a function for each of the main operations you will have to do.

You can always interact directly with `docker compose` if you prefer and get examples from the `./template.sh` script.

## The environment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **TEMPLATE TODO:**
> When open-sourcing your project, share the generic images you built on a public registry.
> Otherwise, delete the last bullet below in the guides for running the environment.

We provide the following guides for obtaining/building and running the environment:

- To run the image locally with Docker & Docker Compose, follow the instructions
  to [obtain/build the environment](#obtainingbuilding-the-environment) then
  the instructions [run locally with Docker Compose](#running-locally-with-docker-compose).
- To run on the EPFL Run:ai clusters, follow the instructions
  to [obtain/build the environment](#obtainingbuilding-the-environment)
  then refer to the `./EPFL-runai-setup/README.md`.

  The guide also provides instructions to do remote development on the Run:ai cluster.
  Other managed cluster users can get inspiration from it too.
- We also provide an image with the dependencies needed to run the environment
  that you can use with your favorite OCI-compatible container runtime.
  Follow the instructions
  in [Running with your favorite container runtime](#running-with-your-favorite-container-runtime) for the details.

## Obtaining/building the environment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **TEMPLATE TODO:**
> After pushing your generic images, provide the image name on your private registry to your teammates,
> or later on a public registry if you open-source your project.
> Add it below in the TODO ADD PULL_IMAGE_NAME.

### Prerequisites

* `docker` (`docker version` >= v23). [Install here.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)
* `docker compose` (`docker compose version` >= v2). [Install here.](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Clone the repository

Clone the git repository.

```bash
git clone <URL/SSH> template-project-name
cd template-project-name
```

### Obtain/build the images

All commands should be run from the `installation/docker-amd64-cuda/` directory.

```bash
cd installation/docker-amd64-cuda
```

1. Create an environment file for your personal configuration with
   ```bash
   ./template.sh env
   ```
   This creates a `.env` file with pre-filled values.
    - The `USRID` and `GRPID` are used to give the container user read/write access to the volumes that will be mounted
      when the container is run, containing the code of the project, the data, and where you'll write your outputs.
      Edit them so that they match the user permissions on the mounted volumes.
      (If you're deploying locally, i.e., where you're building, these values should be filled correctly by default.)

      (**EPFL Note:** _These should match the permissions on your lab's shared storage when mounting from there
      and running on some shared infrastructure, like HaaS setup with LDAP login or Run:ai.
      They will typically be your GASPAR credentials.
      CLAIRE members should use the `claire-storage` group._)
    - `LAB_NAME` will be the first element in name of the local images you get.

      (**EPFL Note:** _If pushing to the IC or RCP registries this should be the name of your lab's project
      in the registry.
      CLAIRE members should use `claire`._)
    - You can ignore the rest of the variables after `## For running locally`.
      These don't influence the build, they will be used later to run your image.

2. Pull or build the generic images.
   These are the runtime (`run`) and development (`dev`) images with root as user.
   The runtime images will be used to run the code in an unattended way.
   The dev image has additional utilities that facilitate development in the container.
   They will be named according to the image name in your `.env`.
   They will be tagged with `run-latest-root` and `dev-latest-root` and if you're building them,
   they will also be tagged with the latest git commit hash `run-<sha>-root` and `dev-<sha>-root`.
    - Pull the generic images if they're available.
      ```bash
      # Pull the generic image if available.
      ./template.sh pull_generic TODO ADD PULL_IMAGE_NAME (private or public).
      ````
    - Otherwise, build them.
      ```bash
      ./template.sh build_generic
      ```
3. You can run quick checks on the image to check it that it has what you expect it to have:
   ```bash
   # Check all your dependencies are there.
   ./template.sh list_env

    # Get a shell and check manually other things.
    # This will only contain the environment and not the project code.
    # Project code can be debugged on the cluster directly.
    ./template.sh empty_interactive
   ```

4. Build the images configured for your user.
   ```bash
   ./template.sh build_user
   ```
   This will build a user layer on top of each generic image
   and tag them `*-*-${USR}` instead of `*-*-root`.
   These will be the images that you actually run and deploy to match the permissions on your mounted storage.

## Running locally with Docker Compose

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **TEMPLATE TODO:**
> If you change the hardware acceleration
> 1. change the `compose.yaml` file to adapt the
     > `run-local-cuda` and `dev-local-cuda` to the new hardware acceleration.
> 2. change the supported values of the `ACCELERATION` listed below.
> 3. change the prerequisites for the hardware acceleration.

**Prerequisites**

Steps prefixed with [CUDA] are only required to use NVIDIA GPUs.

* `docker` (`docker version` >= v23). [Install here.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)
* `docker compose` (`docker compose version` >= v2). [Install here.](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* [CUDA] [Nvidia CUDA Driver](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx) (Only the driver. No CUDA toolkit, etc.)
* [CUDA] `nvidia-docker` (the NVIDIA Container
  Toolkit). [Install here.](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker)

**Run**

Edit the `.env` file to specify which hardware acceleration to use with the `ACCELERATION` variable.
Supported values are `cpu` and `cuda`.

Then you can:

- Start the development container with
    ```bash
    ./template.sh up
    ```
  This will start a container running the development image in the background.
  It has an entrypoint that installs the project, checking that the code directory has correctly been mounted.
  The Docker Compose run and dev services are already setup to mount the project code and specify its location
  to the entrypoint.

  You can check its logs with
    ```bash
    ./template.sh logs
    ```
  and open a shell in this background container with
    ```bash
    ./template.sh shell
    ```
  You can stop the container or delete it with
    ```bash
    # To stop.
    ./template.sh stop
    # Which can then be restarted with
    ./template.sh start
    # Or, to delete.
    ./template.sh down
    ```

- Run jobs in independent containers running the runtime image with
    ```bash
    # You can for example open tmux shells and run your experiments in them.
    ./template.sh run your_command
    ./template.sh run python --version
    ./template.sh run python -m template_package_name.some_experiment some_arg=some_value
    ```
  These containers start with the entrypoint and then run the command you specified.
  By default, they are automatically removed after they exit.

  You should not need to override the entrypoint of the container, it performs important setups.
  It installs the project from its mounted location when specified to avoid hacky imports,
  runs the original entrypoint of your base image if it exists,
  and execs your command with PID 1.
  Only do so if you need to debug the entrypoint itself or if you have a custom use case.

### Development

For remote development with this Docker Compose setup, you should have your IDE
running on the machine where you run the Docker Compose services (not inside the container),
E.g. Pycharm Remote Development or VSCode Remote Development.

Then you would use the remote development features of this IDE to connect to the container
through Docker Compose with `dev-local-${ACCELERATION}` service, if the IDE allows,
which has the mount set up to the code directory.
Otherwise, through the image directly and you'll have to add the mount yourself
(look at how this is done in `compose.yaml`).

## Running with your favorite container runtime

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **TEMPLATE TODO:**
> Provide the images and fill the TODO link, or delete this section.

An image with the runtime environment and an image with the development environment (includes shell utilities)
both running as root (but with a configured zshell for users specified at runtime as well)
is available at TODO: LINK TO PUBLIC IMAGE.

The tags are `run-latest-root` and `dev-latest-root` for the runtime and development images respectively.
You can use your favorite container runtime to run these images.

They have an entrypoint which installs the project with pip
and expects it to be mounted in the container and its location specified with the
environment variable `PROJECT_ROOT_AT`.
E.g., you can mount it at `/project/template-project-name` and specify `PROJECT_ROOT_AT=/project/template-project-name`.
The entrypoint can then take any command to run in the container and will run it with PID 1.
(If you don't specify the `PROJECT_ROOT_AT`, the entrypoint will skip the project installation and warn you about it.)

You can refer to the `EPFL-runai-setup/README.md` for an idea of how this would work on a Kubernetes cluster
interfaced with Run:ai.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **TEMPLATE TODO:**
> Remove the [FROM-PYTHON] or [FROM-SCRATCH] prefix of the method you use and delete the other method's section.

## [FROM-PYTHON] Instructions to maintain the environment

The environment is based on an image which already contains system and Python dependencies.
Extra dependencies are managed as follows:

System dependencies are managed by `apt`.
Python dependencies are managed by `pip`.

Complex dependencies that may require a custom installation
should have their instructions performed in the `Dockerfile` directly.

There are two ways to add dependencies to the environment:

1. **Manually edit the dependency files.**
   This will be needed the first time you set up the environment.
   It will also be useful if you run into conflicts and have to restart from scratch.
2. **Add/upgrade dependencies interactively** while running a shell in the container to experiment with which
   dependency is needed.
   This is probably what you'll be doing after building the image for the first time.

In both cases, after any change, a snapshot of the full environment
specification should be written to the dependency files.
We describe how to do so in the Freeze the Environment section.

### Manual editing (before/while building)

- To add `apt` dependencies, edit the `dependencies/apt-*.txt` files.
  `apt` dependencies are separated into three files to help with multi-stage builds and keep final images small.
    - In `apt-build.txt` put the dependencies needed to build the environment, e.g., compilers, build tools, etc.
      We provide a set of minimal dependencies as an example.
    - In `apt-runtime.txt` put the dependencies needed to run the environment, e.g., image processing libraries.
    - In `apt-dev.txt` put the utilities that will help you develop in the container, e.g. `htop`, `vim`, etc.

  If you're not familiar with which dependencies are needed for each stage, you can start with the minimal set we
  give, and when you encounter errors during the image build, add the missing dependencies to the stage where the error
  occurred.
- To edit `pip` dependencies, edit the `dependencies/requirements.txt` file.
- To edit the more complex dependencies, edit the `Dockerfile`.

When manually editing the dependency files,
you do not need to specify the specific version of all the dependencies,
these will be written to the file when you freeze the environment.
You should just specify the major versions of specific dependencies you need.

### Interactively (while developing)

* To add `apt`  dependencies run `sudo apt install <package>`
* To add `pip` dependencies run `pip install <package>`

### Freeze the environment

After any change to the dependencies, a snapshot of the full environment specification should be written to the
dependency files.
This includes changes during a build and changes made interactively.
This is to ensure that the environment is reproducible and that the dependencies are tracked at any point in time.

To do so, run the following from a login shell in the container.
The script overwrites the `dependencies/requirements.txt` file with the current environment specification,
so it's a good idea to commit the changes to the environment file before/after running it.

The script isn't just a `pip freeze` and the file it generates isn't made to recreate the environment from scratch,
it is tightly coupled to the Dockerfile and the base image it uses.
In this sense, packages that are already installed in the base image or installed by the Dockerfile
may not be listed in the file or may be listed without a version 
(this is because that may have been installed from wheels not present anymore in the final image).

The purpose of the generated `requirements.txt` is to be used always at the same stage of the Dockerfile
to install the same set of missing dependencies between its previous stage and its next stage.
(so not reinstall the dependencies already installed in the base image, for example).
In any case,
the Dockerfile also records the snapshots of the dependency files used to generate each stage for debugging that can be
found in the `/opt/template-dependencies/` directory. 

```bash
update-env-file
```

The script isn't perfect, and there are some caveats (e.g., packages installed from GitHub with pip),
so have a look at the output file to make sure it does what you want.
The `dependencies/update-env-file.sh` gives some hints for what to do,
and in any case you can always patch the file manually.

For dependencies that require a custom installation or build, edit the `Dockerfile`.
If one of these complex dependencies shows in the `requirements.txt` after the freeze,
you have to remove it, so that pip does not pick it up, and it is installed independently in the `Dockerfile`.
(Something similar is done in the `update-env-file`.)

For `apt` dependencies add them manually to the `apt-*.txt` files.

## [FROM-SCRATCH] Instructions to maintain the environment

System dependencies are managed by both `apt` and `conda`.
Python dependencies are managed by both `conda` and `pip`.

- Use `apt` for system programs (e.g. `sudo`, `zsh`, `gcc`),
  leave libraries (e.g., image libraries etc.) to `conda` whenever possible.
- Use `conda` for non-Python dependencies needed to run the project code (e.g. `mkl`, `swig`, `imageio`, etc.).
- Use `conda` for Python dependencies packaged with more than just Python code (e.g. `pytorch`, `numpy`).
  These will typically be your main dependencies and will likely not change as your project grows.
- Use `pip` for the rest of the Python dependencies.
- For more complex dependencies that may require a custom installation or build, use the `Dockerfile` directly.

Here are references and reasons to follow the above claims:

* [A guide for managing `conda` + `pip` environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#using-pip-in-an-environment).
* [Reasons to  use `conda` for not-Python-only dependencies](https://numpy.org/install/#numpy-packages--accelerated-linear-algebra-libraries).
* [Ways of combining `conda` and `pip`](https://towardsdatascience.com/conda-essential-concepts-and-tricks-e478ed53b5b#42cb).

There are two ways to add dependencies to the environment:

1. **Manually edit the dependency files.**
   This will be needed the first time you set up the environment.
   It will also be useful if you run into conflicts and have to restart from scratch.
2. **Add/upgrade dependencies interactively** while running a shell in the container to experiment with which
   dependency is needed.
   This is probably what you'll be doing after building the image for the first time.

In both cases, after any change, a snapshot of the full environment specification should be written
to the dependency files.
We describe how to do so in the Freeze the Environment section.

### Manual editing (before/while building)

- To edit the `apt` dependencies, edit the `dependencies/apt-*.txt` files.
  `apt` dependencies are separated into three files to help with multi-stage builds and keep final images small.
    - In `apt-build.txt` put the dependencies needed to build the environment, e.g., compilers, build tools, etc.
      We provide a set of minimal dependencies as an example.
    - In `apt-runtime.txt` put the dependencies needed to run the environment, e.g., image processing libraries when not
      available in conda, etc.
    - In `apt-dev.txt` put the utilities that will help you develop in the container, e.g. `htop`, `vim`, etc.

  If you're not familiar with which dependencies are needed for each stage, you can start with the minimal set we
  give.
  When you encounter errors during the image build, add the missing dependencies to the stage where the error
  occurred.
- To edit the `conda` and `pip` dependencies, edit the `dependencies/environment.yml` file.
- To edit the more complex dependencies, edit the `Dockerfile`.

When manually editing the dependency files,
you do not need to specify the specific version of all the dependencies,
these will be written to the file when you freeze the environment.
You should just specify the major versions of specific dependencies you need.

### Interactively (while developing)

`conda` dependencies should all be installed before any `pip` dependency.
This will cause conflicts otherwise as `conda` doesn't track the `pip` dependencies.
So if you need to add a `conda` dependency after you already installed some `pip` dependencies, you need to recreate
the environment by manually adding the dependencies before the build as described in the previous section.

* To add `apt`  dependencies run `sudo apt install <package>`
* To add `conda` dependencies run `mamba install <package>`
* To add `pip` dependencies run `pip install <package>`

### Freeze the environment

After any change to the dependencies, a snapshot of the full environment specification should be written to the
dependency files.
This includes changes during a build and changes made interactively.
This is to ensure that the environment is reproducible and that the dependencies are tracked at any point in time.

To do so, run the following from a login shell in the container.
The script overwrites the `dependencies/environment.yml` file with the current environment specification,
so it's a good idea to commit the changes to the environment file before/after running it.

The script isn't just a `mamba env export`
and the file it generates isn't made to recreate the complete environment from scratch,
it is tightly coupled to the Dockerfile.
In this sense, packages it installs may depend on system dependencies installed by the Dockerfile
and dependencies installed at later stages will not be listed.

**Note:** A strict `mamba env export` is recorded 

The purpose of the generated `environment.yml` is to be used always at the same stage of the Dockerfile
to install the initial set of dependencies.
(and not install dependencies that the Dockerfile will build and install later).
In any case,
the Dockerfile also records the snapshots of the dependency files used to generate each stage for debugging that can be
found in the `/opt/template-dependencies/` directory. 

```bash
update-env-file
```

The script isn't perfect, and there are some caveats (e.g., packages installed from GitHub with pip),
so have a look at the output file to make sure it does what you want.
The `dependencies/update-env-file.sh` gives some hints for what to do,
and in any case you can always patch the file manually.

For dependencies that require a custom installation or build, edit the `Dockerfile`.
If one of these complex dependencies shows in the `environment.yml` after the freeze,
you have to remove it, so that conda does not pick it up, and it is installed independently in the `Dockerfile`.

For `apt` dependencies add them manually to the `apt-*.txt` files.

## Troubleshooting

### Debugging the Docker build

If your build fails at some point, the build will print the message with the line in the Dockerfile
that caused the error.
Identify the stage at in which the line is: it's the earliest FROM X as Y before the line.
Then add a new stage right before the failing line starting from the stage you identified.
Something like:

```dockerfile
FROM X as Y

RUN something-that-works

# Add this line.
FROM Y as debug

RUN something-that-breaks
```

Then in the `compose.yaml` file, change the `target: runtime-generic` to `target: Y`
(replacing Y with its correct stage name).
Your build will then stop at the line before the failing line.

```bash
# Say you're building the generic images.
./template.sh build_generic
```

You can open a shell in that layer and debug the issue.

```bash
# IMAGE_NAME can be found in the .env file.
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /bin/bash ${IMAGE_NAME}:run-latest-root
```

### My image doesn't build with my initial dependencies.

Try removing the dependencies causing the issue, rebuilding, and then installing them interactively when running the
container.
The error messages will possibly be more informative, and you will be able to dig into the issue.

Alternatively, you can open a container at the layer before the installation of the dependencies,
like described above, and try to install the environment manually.
