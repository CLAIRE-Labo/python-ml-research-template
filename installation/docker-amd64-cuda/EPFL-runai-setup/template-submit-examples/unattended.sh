# To separate the dev state of the project from frozen checkouts to be used in unattended jobs you can observe that
# we're pointing to the .../run instance of the repository on the PVC.
# That would be a copy of the template-project-name repo frozen in a commit at a working state to be used in unattended jobs.
# Otherwise while developing we would change the code that would be picked by newly scheduled jobs.

# Useful commands.
# runai describe job example-unattended
# runai logs example-unattended
