## Notes:
# This will start an ssh server in the container, without setting up your project
## The important bits here are:
# 1.The command to mount your pcv.
# --pvc your_pvc_name:/where_to_mount_your_pvc (you can mount it anywhere)
# we recommend always mounting it inside the / directory always with the same name.
# 2. the environment variables that the configure the entrypoint.
# -e SSH_SERVER=1 will make the entrypoint start an ssh server.

# Also note that here we are using the dev image (dev-latest-moalla)
# which contains the dependencies to open the ssh server.

## Useful commands.
# runai describe job example-first-steps
# runai logs example-first-steps
# kubectl port-forward example-first-steps-0-0  2222:22
# If you setup your ssh config you can then
# ssh runai
