# Records the current environment to a file.
# Packages installed from GitHub with pip install <git url> will not be recorded
# properly (i.e. the link can be omitted and just replaced with the version).
# In that case, you have to update this file to add commands that
# will fix the environment file.
# (you could also patch the file manually afterwards).
# Similarly the conda channels used to install packages may not be recorded properly
# if you used complex combinations of channels.
# In that case you also have to make the edits here or patch the file manually.
